# MYSQL
This repo is my MySQL learning journey step by step. It includes DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, joins, subqueries, functions, procedures, and mini projects. Iâ€™m uploading practice queries and scripts as I learn, to track my progress and make it easier for beginners to understand MySQL in a practical way.
